Multi-Subwoofer Time Delay & Polarity Optimizer (CUDA | Windows | NVIDIA GPU)
A GPU-accelerated brute-force optimizer for aligning multiple subwoofers via relative time delay and polarity (inversion). This tool ensures optimal results by exhaustively evaluating all possible combinations within the specified delay range.

üöÄ Key Features
Brute-force precision: Exhaustive search guarantees the best alignment‚Äîno approximations or shortcuts.

GPU-accelerated: Optimized for memory coalescing and parallel execution on NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA.

Blazing fast: Near-instant results for up to 3 subs. With 4 subs, it can power through up to 1 trillion iterations in just a few hours on an RTX 3090 (Compute Capability 8.6).

Flexible resolution: Use fine delay steps (e.g. 0.1 ms) or coarser ones for faster results.

Human-hearing-aware optimization: Uses linearly weighted magnitude sums that approximate human hearing when REW exports use the PPO scale.

üì¶ Requirements
Windows PC

NVIDIA GPU (Compute Capability 5.2 / Maxwell or newer ‚Äî RTX 3000+ recommended)

CUDA 12.9

Visual Studio 2022 (for building from source) or use the included .exe

Subwoofer measurements exported from REW as .txt files

Tab- or comma-separated formats supported

Use 96 PPO for best results

All subwoofers must be measured at the same mic position with a timing reference

üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions
To build from source:

Open the project in Visual Studio 2022

Set CUDA to version 12.9

Enable "Use Fast Math" in CUDA build settings

Build and run!

Or, just use the precompiled binary:
_win64_RTX3000+seriesGPU.exe

üìÅ Input Files
Export each subwoofer's frequency and phase response from REW (.txt format). Measurements should be aligned to a timing reference and taken from the same mic position.

üë®‚Äçüíª About
This tool uses a deliberately simple (and "dumb") brute-force method, exploiting modern GPU speed to guarantee optimal alignment. While not elegant, it's effective and fast‚Äîespecially on high-end NVIDIA GPUs.
